Note: Some of the things are there but they dont work as planned. Like the username, as well as the profile picture. The game is slow. U can click multiple
sqaures at once but the game will not break and you can still play if you press the sqaure again and match properly. Just wait for the sqaures to check for
a match then press. The start button dont work not ahaha I cant fix it in time. Reset work it is glitcht the sqaures become invisible but will re reveal once
pressed idk how to fix that i tried lamo. Overall most features work.
